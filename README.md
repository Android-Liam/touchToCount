# touchToCount
I am developing an app that counts when you touch it. By saving it through SQLite, the goal is to keep the counted number the same even if you turn the app off and on.

# Result

1. When you touch the black screen, the number increases.
2. Press Reset to reset the number.
3. Because SQLite is used, the counted number is still applied even if you turn the app off and on again.
